I am sharing some exercises I completed throughout the course by Katya Kovalenko to translate complex stories into simple images.

**Qualitative Visualisation**
I chose the quote from Confucius: "It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop." This quote emphasizes the importance of perseverance and continuous effort in achieving one's goals.

- I sketched thinking about a race, an ultra-marathon to be more precise, where you can get lost, reduce your pace, or even stop for a while, but it is possible to complete the journey.
- Although progress may be slow, it is organic, akin to a heart monitor, with its highs and lows.
- It is also possible to backtrack multiple times to get back on track and achieve what is wanted.

I chose the Adobe XD software to try, as I have used Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign for so long. It is a bit different but works better to produce social media content.

**Quantitative Visualisation**
It took me a lot of time to choose data from reports. Then I finally found a leaflet by Instituto Polis that is organizing an online course I am enrolled in. I would like to find data about women that were somehow easy to represent.

- I tried several sketches, but I was not happy with them, so I decided to bring the information to Adobe XD and see how it goes.
- For the first image, a bar chart would be the best recommendation for comparison between men and women.
- For the others, a pie chart would be recommended, but to make it a bit different, I zoomed in so it is not possible to see the edges of these pie charts.
